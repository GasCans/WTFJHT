1/ **Trump is considering a "huge reboot"** that could take out everyone from Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon, to counsel Don McGahn and Sean Spicer. Trump is irritated with several Cabinet members and "frustrated, and angry at everyone."

2/ **Senate Republicans are looking at steep cuts to Medicaid that could drop millions of people from coverage** and reduce programs for the poor. Under pressure to balance the budget, Republicans are considering slashing more than $400 billion in spending on food stamps, welfare, and even veterans’ benefits through a process to evade Democratic filibusters in the Senate. If the Medicaid cutbacks get passed both chambers, it could significantly scale back the federal-state insurance program that covers 73 million low-income or disabled Americans and shift significant costs onto hospitals and states.

4/ **North Korea successfully test-fired a new type of ballistic missile**, signaling an advance in their development of an intercontinental ballistic missile.

5/ **9th Circuit Court to hear the travel ban appeal, again**. A three-judge panel will hear a challenge to a Hawaii judge's decision to halt travel ban 2.0. Lawyers at the Justice Department must convince at least two of the judges to ignore Trump's record of campaign calls to ban Muslims from entering the US.

8/ **White Nationalist Richard Spencer lead a torch-bearing group protesting the sale of a statue of Robert E. Lee in Virginia**. The group chanted “You will not replace us."
